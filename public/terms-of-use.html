          </li>
          <li>Your affirmative act of using the App or Site and/or registering for the App or

            and your consent to enter into agreements with us electronically</li>
          <li>. The platform may only be used in good faith and may not be used to transmit or
            otherwise make available any information that is false or that you do not have a
            right to make available under any law or under contractual relationships (such
            as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or
            disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure
            agreements), to threaten, abuse, harass, or invade the rights of any person or
            entity, to infringe on any person or entity's intellectual property rights, or in any
            other way that could reasonably be deemed unethical, illegal, or offensive.
          </li>
          <li>You may not misidentify yourself or impersonate any person or entity, or falsely
            state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity (e.g.,
            pretend to be a different person or from a different company or organization).
          </li>
          <li>. Unless you have our prior written consent, you will not post advertisements or
            promotional materials, solicit participants and/or visitors of the Site, reproduce,
            duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion
            of the App or Site or its Services, use of the App or Site or it Services, or access to
            the App or Site or its Services.
          </li>
          <li> You are prohibited from using any type of computer 'worm,' 'virus' or any other
            device that is intended or is likely to disrupt, overload, or otherwise impair the
            workings of any part of the App or Site. If you do engage in such conduct, the
            resulting damage will be hard to quantify as a fixed amount and thus you hereby
            agree to pay us liquidated damages in the amount of Rs. 1,00,000 for each day
            that the App or Site is damaged until the App or Site is completely repaired and
            further unquantified damages which will occur due to your act will be accessed
            and you shall be liable to pay the same. This amount is derived by estimating the
            value of (1) the loss of good will caused by an inoperable site or app, (2) the
            time and money it will take to repair the App or Site and to address the concerns
            of visitors. We are required to use reasonable efforts to repair the App or Site as
            quickly as possible. This clause will not prohibit us from seeking additional
            compensation if your conduct injures us in a way not expressly contemplated
            herein</li>
          <li>You are not permitted to collect or store personal data about other users.</li>
          <li>You are not permitted to access the App or Site for the purpose of data
            mining or extracting content from the App or Site beyond your personal end
            use.
          </li>
          <li>You are permitted to use the App or Site to find a Partner to perform services
            for you related to your problem and to obtain general information about similar
            cases (each, a "Permissible Use"). You are not permitted to use App or Site for
            any other reason other than a Permissible Use as described above.
            Impermissible Uses shall include, but are not limited to, using the App or Site to
            order to hire, engage or otherwise work with the employees or affiliates of ZOffers
            or the Partners, to interfere or attempt to interfere in the relationship between
            ZOffers and such employees, affiliates, Partner, or for any other purpose other
            than described herein (each, an "Impermissible Use"). If you do engage in such
            conduct, the resulting damage will be hard to quantify as a fixed amount and
            thus you hereby agree to pay us liquidated damages in the amount of
            Rs.2,50,000 for each Impermissible Use, and further unquantified damages
            which will occur due to your act will be accessed and you shall be liable to pay
            the same. You further agree that this liquidated damages provision reasonably
            approximates actual costs, losses, and expenses which would be incurred by
            ZOffers due to any such Impermissible Use. You also agree that nothing in this
            section is intended to limit ZOffers's right to obtain injunctive and other relief as
            may be appropriate</li>

            update the information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you

            and/or we have reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue,
            inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate
